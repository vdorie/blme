\description{
  Maximum a posteriori estimation for linear and generalized

\arguments{
  \item{cov.prior}{a BLME \link[=bmerDist-class]{prior} or list of priors with allowable
    distributions: \code{wishart}, \code{invwishart}, \code{gamma},
    \code{invgamma}, or \code{NULL}. Imposes a prior over the covariance of the random
    effects/modeled coefficients. Default is \code{wishart}. The \code{NULL} argument
    imposes flat priors over all relevant parameters.}
  \item{fixef.prior}{a BLME prior of family \code{normal}, \code{t}, \code{horseshoe}, or \code{NULL}.
    Imposes a prior over the fixed effects/modeled coefficients.
    Default is \code{NULL}.}
  \item{resid.prior}{a BLME prior of family \code{gamma}, \code{invamma}, \code{point}
    or \code{NULL}. Imposes a prior over the noise/residual variance, also known as common scale
    parameter or the conditional variance given the random effects.
    Default is \code{NULL}.}
  \item{start}{like the \code{start} arguments for \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}} and
    \code{\link[lme4]{glmer}} a numeric vector or named list. Unlike the aforementioned,
    list members of \code{fixef} and \code{sigma} are applicable to linear mixed models
    provided that numeric optimization is required for these parameters.}

\details{
  The bulk of the usage for \code{blmer} and \code{bglmer} closely
  follows the functions \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}} and
  \code{\link[lme4]{glmer}}. Those help pages provide a good overview of
  fitting linear and generalized linear mixed models. The primary
  distinction is that \code{blmer} and \code{bglmer} allow the user to
  do Bayesian inference or penalized maximum likelihood, with priors imposed on the different
  model components. For the specifics of any distribution listed below,
  see the \link[=bmerDist-class]{distributions} page.
  
  \strong{Covariance Prior}
  
  The \code{cov.prior} argument applies a prior over the
  covariance matrix of the random effects/modeled coefficients.
  As there is one covariance matrix for every named grouping factor -
  that is every element that appears to the right of a vertical bar
  ("|") in the model formula - it is possible to apply as many
  different priors as there are said factors.
  
  The general formats of an argument to \code{blmer} or \code{bglmer}
  for such a prior are of the form:

\itemize{
  \item \code{cov.prior = factor.name ~ covariance.distribution(option1 = value1, \dots)}
  \item \code{cov.prior = list(fc.nm ~ dist1, fc.nm ~ dist2, ..., default.distribution)}
}
  
  If the \dQuote{\code{factor.name ~}} construct is omitted, the prior
  is interpretted as a default and applied to all factors that
  lack specific priors of their own. Options are not required,
  but permit fine-tuning of the model.

  Supported distributions are \code{gamma}, \code{invgamma}, \code{wishart},
  \code{invwishart}, \code{NULL}, and \code{custom}.

  The \code{common.scale} option, a logical, determines whether or
  not the prior applies to in the absolute-real world
  sense (value = \code{FALSE}), or if the prior is applied to the random effect
  covariance divided by the estimated residual variance (\code{TRUE}). As a practical matter,
  when false computation can be slower as the profiled common scale may
  no longer have a closed-form solution. As such, the default for all
  cases is \code{TRUE}.

  Other options are specified along with the specific distributions and
  defaults are explained in the blme \link[=bmerDist-class]{distributions} page.  

  \strong{Fixed Effects Prior}
  
  Priors on the fixed effects, or unmodeled coefficients, are specified
  in a fashion similar to that of covariance priors. The general format is

\itemize{\item \code{fixef.prior = multivariate.distribution(options1 = value1, \dots)}}
  
  At present, the implemented multivariate distributions are \code{normal}, \code{t},
  \code{horseshoe}, and \code{NULL}. \code{t} and \code{horseshoe} priors cannot be used
  when \code{REML} is \code{TRUE}, as that integral does not have a closed form solution.

  \strong{Residual Variance Prior}

  The general format for a residual variance prior is the same as for a fixed
  effect prior. The supported distributions are \code{point}, \code{gamma},
  \code{invgamma}.

### Examples using a covariance prior ##

# Here we are ignoring convergence warnings just to illustate how the package
# is used: this is not a good idea in practice..

# of the space.
