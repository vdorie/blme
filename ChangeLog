  * Fix for programmatically defined variables not working with glmm priors. Bug fix thanks to mgoplerud.

2015-05-28 Vincent Dorie <vjd4@nyu.edu>

  * Changed testing framework to testthat from RUnit
  * Brought parity with lme4 1.1-8
  * Overload refit generic so that it gets the correct deviance function

2015-03-10 Vincent Dorie <vjd4@nyu.edu>

  * Fixed bug with t prior display on scalar variable

2014-08-14 Vincent Dorie <vjd4@nyu.edu>

  * Now correctly stores lme4 convergence warnings

2014-07-09 Vincent Dorie <vjd4@nyu.edu>

  * added CITATION file

  * Brought to parity with the latest lme4 release (1.1-6).
  * Bug fixes:
      quadratic term for normal priors calculated incorrectly when using non-zero correlations
      glmms could fail to apply full penalty term for mixed use of covariance priors
  * New features:
      t priors for fixed effects
      custom priors for ranef covariances

  * Complete re-write for lme4 version 1.0.

2013-08-12 10:25 Vincent Dorie <vjd4@nyu.edu>

  * Minor addition to testing suite set of functions. Upgraded to lme4 0.999999-2.
  * Changed dependency to lme4.0.

  * Common scale is now optional for random effect covariance, specified with the "common.scale" parameter and taking values TRUE/FALSE.
  * Covariance priors can now all be improper.
  * Common scale prior can now be inverse gamma on sd, or gamma.
  * Reworked how the penalized weighted residual sum of squares is calculated, as it may not make sense depending on what priors are used.
  * Brought to parity with the latest version of lme4, 0.999999 or so.
  * Eliminated a false zero problem wherein the optimizer takes an initial step to the boundary and get stuck due to a flat likelihood.

  * blme now ignores the common scale when penalizing the random effect covariance. In previous versions it multiplied it in but didn't take the prior into account when profiling it out - in essence failing to correspond to a probabilistic model. The next version will allow the prior to be on the scale-free covariance, or on the real-world covariance matrix. For now, just the scale-free version.  ** This means the fitted models will be different than previous versions.  **
  * Reduced the default shape for random-effect covariance posteriors on the variance scale so that the polynomial term has an exponent of 1 in the univariate case. The multivariate now has df of dim + 1 to correspond.
  * Fixed a few typos in the documentation.
  * Cleaned up imports from NAMESPACE file.
  * Replaced a .Internal call.

  * Fixed off-by one bug on termination of the optimization loop which caused gradient evaluation steps to be reported a the maximum.
  * REML optimization for sigma with a fixef prior was slightly off.
  * sigma now accepts inverse gamma priors (improper, as well).
  * Internal version of sim().

  * Prevented summary from printing misc. lines when only one covariance prior is implemented. Gaussian fixed effects priors summarize in terms of their covariance correctly when the covariance is diagonal or a scalar times the identity.


2011-11-15 17:03 Vincent Dorie <vjd4@nyu.edu>

  * Fixed a bug related to the scaling of priors to the data in the presence of interactions.
  * Added point priors on the common scale, enabling meta-analyses.


2010-12-19 19:27 Vincent Dorie <vjd4@nyu.edu>
  * Initial version.
